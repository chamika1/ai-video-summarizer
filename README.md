## üöÄ Overview

Video Analyzer AI is a Flask-based web application that leverages the power of Google's Gemini API to provide insightful analysis of your video content. Upload a video, and get a comprehensive summary, ask questions about its content in multiple languages, and more!

The application features a sleek, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS and includes functionalities for automatic and manual cleanup of processed files.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Effortless Video Upload:** Simple drag & drop or click-to-select interface.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Get summaries and ask questions in English, Sinhala, and Tamil.
*   **Comprehensive AI Summaries:** Detailed summaries generated by Google Gemini, capturing key aspects, narrative flow, and conclusions.
*   **Full Dialogue Extraction:** Retrieves the complete dialogue script from the video, if available.
*   **Interactive Q&A:** Ask specific questions about the video content and get AI-generated answers.
*   **Dynamic Progress Tracking:** Real-time feedback on upload and AI processing status.
*   **Intelligent Caching:** Processed video data is cached to provide faster responses for subsequent analyses of the same video.
*   **File Management:**
    *   **Manual Cleanup:** "Clean & New Analysis" button to clear all uploaded videos and cached data for a fresh start.
    *   **Automatic Cleanup:** Old files (older than 6 hours) are automatically deleted from server storage.
*   **Modern UI:** Responsive and visually appealing interface using Tailwind CSS and FontAwesome icons.
*   **Toast Notifications:** User-friendly notifications for important actions and statuses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend:**
    *   Python 3.9+
    *   Flask (for the web framework)
    *   Flask-CORS (for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    *   Google Generative AI SDK (`google-generativeai` for interacting with Gemini API)
*   **Frontend:**
    *   HTML5
    *   Tailwind CSS (for styling)
    *   JavaScript (for client-side interactivity)
    *   FontAwesome (for icons)
*   **Database/Cache:**
    *   File-based caching for video analysis data (JSON files).
*   **Key Libraries Used:**
    *   `Werkzeug` (WSGI utility library for Flask)
    *   `Pillow` (Image processing - though not directly used in the core video analysis, it's in `requirements.txt`)
    *   `python-dotenv` (for managing environment variables)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Video Analyzer AI running on your local machine:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.9 or higher installed.
    *   `pip` (Python package installer) installed.

2.  **Clone the Repository (Example):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/video-analyzer-ai.git
    cd video-analyzer-ai
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Google Gemini API Key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *Note: The application currently has a placeholder API key in `app.py`. It's highly recommended to use the `.env` file method or another secure way to manage your API key, especially for production.*

6.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2.  **Upload a Video:**
    *   Drag and drop a video file onto the upload area.
    *   Or, click the upload area to select a video file from your computer.
    *   Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM (Max: 500MB).
3.  **Track Progress:** Observe the progress bar for upload and AI analysis status.
4.  **Generate Summary:** Once the upload and initial processing are complete, click the "Generate Summary" button. Select your desired language for the summary.
5.  **Ask Questions:** Type your questions about the video in the input field and click "Ask" or press Enter.
6.  **Clean & New Analysis:** If you want to clear all previous video data and start fresh, click the "Clean & New Analysis" button. This will delete files from the `uploads` and `video_cache` directories on the server.
